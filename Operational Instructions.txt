Everything in this program can be controlled with the numpad and arrow keys.  
The arrow keys control the camera, with left and right rotating the camera in the specified direction, whilst up and down move the camera forward and backward respectively.  
Whilst NumLock is on, the directional numbers (8, 4, 6 and 2) will apply a force and move the leftmost cube in the specified direction.  
The number 5 will apply an upward force, and move the cube upwards.  To fall, release the button and gravity will pull the cube downwards.  
Numpad 7 will apply a torque force to the cube, causing it to rotate around an axis.  
Numpad 1 will toggle which type of drag is currently applied to the leftmost cube, swapping between Laminar and Turbulent.  
Numpad 3 will activate buoyancy on the rightmost cube, causing it to float upwards.  
Once in this state, the cube can be interacted with whilst still keeping its buoyancy effect.  
Numpad 0 will reset the leftmost cube to its default position and set the velocity back to 0 in all directions.
